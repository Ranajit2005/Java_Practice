// Create a class with variable(s) and method(s) (all will be default accessed) under package pOne. Now create a class under package pTwo, which is subclass of firstly created class. In the method here (i.e. class of pTwo) call variable(s) and method(s) of pre - vious class (i.e. class of pOne). If errors come, rectify them. Now from Main (under working directory) access second classâ€™s members.

import pTwo.classTwo;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        classTwo a = new classTwo();
        a.accessMember();
        
    }
}
